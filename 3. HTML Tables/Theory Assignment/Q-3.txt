Question 3: Why should tables be used sparingly for layout purposes? What is a better alternative?

ans:- Problems with using tables for layout is:

    1. Not made for layout :-
        -> Tables are meant to show data, not to design the structure of a webpage.

    2. Hard to update :-
        If you want to change something in a table-based layout, it’s difficult and time-consuming.

    3. Not good for mobile :-
        Tables don’t adjust well to small screens like phones or tablets. Your layout might break 
        or look bad.

    4. Messy code :-
        Tables require a lot of extra HTML tags, which makes your code long and harder to read.

    What you should use instead:

        -> A better way to create layouts is by using CSS with semantic tags like <div>,<header>,
        <section>, etc., and tools like Flexbox or Grid.
