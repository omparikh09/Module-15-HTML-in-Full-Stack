Question 2: Explain the difference between the GET and POST methods in form submission.
When should each be used?

ans:- 
    1. GET :- 
        -> Data Transmission :-
            Sends data as query parameters in the URL.
        
        -> Visibility :-
            Data is visible in the URL (less secure).
        
        -> Data Length :-
            Limited by URL length (usually 2000 characters).
        
        -> Use in Browser History / Bookmarking :-
            URL (with data) can be bookmarked or shared.
        
        -> Performance :-
            Faster since data is just appended to URL.

    2. POST :- 
        -> Data Transmission :-
            Sends data in the request body, not visible in the URL.
        
        -> Visibility :-
            Data is hidden from the URL (more secure).
        
        -> Data Length :-
            No practical size limit (depends on server).
        
        -> Use in Browser History / Bookmarking :-
            Cannot be bookmarked with data.
        
        -> Performance :-
            Slower since data is packaged in the request body.

    When to Use Each

    1. Use GET when :-
        -> You don’t need to send sensitive data.
        
        -> The action doesn’t change anything on the server.
        
        -> You want the data to be bookmarkable or shareable via URL.

    2. Use POST when :-
        -> You are sending sensitive or confidential data
        
        -> The action updates or adds something to the server.
        
        -> You’re submitting large or complex forms.
