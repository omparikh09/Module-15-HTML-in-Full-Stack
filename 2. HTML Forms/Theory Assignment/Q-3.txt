Question 3: What is the purpose of the label element in a form, and how does it improve
accessibility?

ans:- The <label> element is used to define a caption for an input element (like text 
fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.).

This improves accessibility because screen readers can read out the label along with the 
input, helping visually impaired users understand the form better
