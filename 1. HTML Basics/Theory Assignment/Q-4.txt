Question 4: Discuss the role of semantic HTML. Why is it important for accessibility and SEO? 
Provide examples of semantic elements.

ans :- Semantic HTML uses tags that clearly describe their purpose and the type of content they 
contain. Instead of generic containers like <div> or <span>, semantic elements like <article>, 
<nav>, and <footer> tell browsers, developers, and assistive technologies what role each part 
of the page plays.

What is it important for accessibility and SEO:

1. Accessibility :-
    Semantic HTML is a game-changer for users who rely on screen readers or other assistive 
    technologies.

    Example :-
        <nav> tells a screen reader that this section is for navigation.
        <main> indicates the primary content, so users can skip to it directly.

2. SEO (Search Engine Optimization) :-
    Search engines rely on structure to understand page content.
    
    Example :-
        <article> signals independent, indexable content (like a blog post).
        <header> and <footer> provide contextual information.
